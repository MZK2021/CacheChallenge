# Caching Fetch Library

This project implements a caching fetch library and demonstrates its use in a React application. It includes server-side rendering and client-side caching features to optimize data fetching and improve performance.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories and files:

### Directories

#### `application/`

This directory contains the main application components.

- **`app.tsx`**: 
  - The main application component.
  - Uses the `useCachingFetch` hook to fetch data from a remote API.
  - Displays a list of people using the `Person` component.
  - Implements `preLoadServerData` for server-side data preloading.

- **`name.tsx`**:
  - A component to display the name of a person.
  - Fetches data using the `useCachingFetch` hook and validates it.
  - Displays the first and last name of a person based on an index.

- **`person.tsx`**:
  - A component to display detailed information about a person.
  - Uses the `useCachingFetch` hook to fetch data and validate it.
  - Displays a person's name (using the `Name` component), email, address, balance, and creation date.

- **`validation.ts`**:
  - Contains validation logic using the `valibot` library.
  - Defines the `dataSchema` for validating fetched data.
  - Exports the `validateData` function to validate data against the schema.

#### `caching-fetch-library/`

This directory contains the implementation of the caching fetch library.

- **`cachingFetch.ts`**:
  - Implements the caching fetch hook (`useCachingFetch`) and related functions.
  - Functions:
    - `useCachingFetch`: A React hook for fetching data with caching.
    - `preloadCachingFetch`: Preloads data on the server.
    - `serializeCache`: Serializes the cache to a string.
    - `initializeCache`: Initializes the cache from a serialized string.
    - `wipeCache`: Clears the cache.

#### `framework/`

This directory contains the server and client framework setup for server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering.

- **`server/`**:
  - **`index.js`**: Entry point for the server-side rendering. Sets up the server and handles SSR.

- **`client/`**:
  - **`index.js`**: Entry point for the client-side rendering. Bootstraps the React application on the client side.

#### `mockServer/`

This directory contains the setup for the mock server used during development and testing.

- **`handlers.js`**:
  - Defines mock handlers for API requests using `msw` (Mock Service Worker).
  - Simulates responses for different API endpoints.

- **`index.js`**:
  - Entry point for starting the mock server.
  - Configures and activates the mock service worker.

- **`mockServiceWorker.js`**:
  - Service worker for intercepting network requests in the browser.
  - Automatically generated by MSW.
  - **Do not modify this file.**

### Files

- **`.prettierrc`**: Configuration file for Prettier, a code formatter.
- **`.prettierignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Prettier.
- **`package.json`**: Defines the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file.
- **`webpack.config.js`**: Configuration file for Webpack, a module bundler.
